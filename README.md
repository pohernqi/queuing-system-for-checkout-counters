# queuing-system-for-checkout-counters

The simulation system that we created is a queuing system for checkout counters
for supermarkets. There are a total of four checkout counters in this simulator, where one
of them is an express checkout counter and the rest of the three counters are normal
checkout counters. The express checkout counter is only open for customers who buy less
items.

When the user launches the simulation system, he or she needs to first choose the
type of random number generator that they want to use. Then, the table of the service
time for four counters and the table of the inter-arrival time for the customers will be
shown by the system. After that, users will be asked to enter the number of customers.
Lastly, the system will output the message for customer arrival, departure and the overall
simulation table.

This simulation system can simulate the arrival of customers at checkout counters
for supermarkets. The system will end when all the customers have arrived at the counter.
The results of the simulation such as average waiting time of a customer, average
inter-arrival time, average time spent, average service time for each counter and
probability of a customer having to wait in a queue, will be evaluated at the end
